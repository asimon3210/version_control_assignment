## Chapter 3 Assignment

From this point onwards, you will be managing your assignments with `git` and submitting them through GitHub. The aim of this assignment is to get you familiarized with a common version control workflow.

#### Getting Started
Make sure you've <em>forked</em> this repository under your own GitHub account, and then clone your own repository to your computer. You will push the changes you've made to this document as submission to GitHub.

If the version control concepts or `git` commands are still confusing to you, consider re-reading and following the online notes, or check out an interactive tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

#### The Assignment:
 0. Create a branch in this assignment repository named `submission`, then list all the branches you have (Hint: look at the Branch chapter of notes on how branches work, how to create new ones, and check existing branches):

    ```bash
    # git command used: `git checkout -b submissions
    # list of branches: 
	main
	*submission
    ```

 1. List the current `remote` name and hyperlink destination of this assignment repository (Hint: if you are not sure, add `--help` after your command to check remotes.). 

    ```bash
    # git command: git remote get-url origin
    # output: https://github.com/asimon3210/version_control_assignment.git   
    ```


 2. Add a second remote destination named `upstream` to your assignment repository, `upstream` is a common name used for the repository that people have forked from, in our case, the `upstream` will be at `https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment`. List the new list of remotes after you've added the new remote. 
 
    ```bash
    # origin  https://github.com/asimon3210/version_control_assignment.git (fetch)                                            origin  https://github.com/asimon3210/version_control_assignment.git (push)                                             upstream        https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment (fetch)                                 upstream        https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment (push) 
    ```

 3. Save your modifications to this file so far and create a commit indicating you've answered the first 2 questions. Then try pushing the changes to the `upstream` destination on GitHub. What happens? Explain in your own words why does this happen? What are the benefits of having this `upstream` remote added when working collaboratively (Hint: read git command outputs!)?

    > I get the following error:
	remote: Permission to WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment.git denied to asimon3210.
	fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/version_control_assignment/': The requested URL returned error: 403
        This is probably because I used an incorrect password to access the WCM-datascibasics account. I didn't have the correct credentials, so I did not have permission to access this remote. The benefits of having the `upstream` remote added when working collaboratively is that you get to keep trach of the changes you made and prevent creating unnecessary divergent lines in the repository. 

 4. Now clone the repository for the [class website](https://github.com/WCM-datascibasics/wcm-datascibasics.github.io), and in the class website repository:
    - a. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph (remember the dog meme?).
        ```bash
        # git command: git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

    - b. Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with an argument)
        ```bash
        # git command: git log -1 README.md
	# output: commit 7897d58f9a9334bcc55a373734c6a0c5a765d95a
Author: Xihe Xie <axiezai@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 6 11:21:02 2021 -0500

    update instructions
        ```
    
    - c. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the `-Week 2` line of `index.md` file? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git show`, check out their help pages if you are not sure what to do)
	```bash
	Commit message: "added ch2 assignment" 
	```

 5. In the course website repository (or another repository you want to clone from GitHub), modify one of its existing files, do not `git add` or `git commit` yet:
     - a. What happens when you do `git stash`, be specific about what happens to your uncommitted changes after `stash`.?
       > Because `git stash` saves the changes I made locally away somewhere else and restores the repository to the last commit, my uncommited changes were reversed when I opened the file I modified. 
     - b. What do you see when you run `git log --all --oneline` after stashing your modification?
       > I see the following at the first line of the output: 3a13bb9 (refs/stash) WIP on master: 540a90d added week5   
     - c. Look up what `git stash drop` and `git stash pop` does, either Google or use `--help`. Run `git stash drop` to undo what you did with `stash`, in what scenario might `stash`-ing, `pop`-ing, and `drop`-ing be useful?
       > `Stash`-ing is useful for when you need to quickly switch content to work on something else, so it allows you to shelve the changes you made and reapply them later on. `Pop`-ing lets you apply the same stashed changes to multiple branches. `Drop`-ing lets you delete a stash you no longer need. 

 6. One common mistake when learning `git` is to commit large files that should not be managed by `git` or adding sensitive information like security keypairs for Amazon Cloud Services. Navigate back to your assignment repository and try adding a random text file to the repository (use `touch`), making some modifications and commits to your repository, and deleting that file with `rm`. But deleting with `rm` will not delete that file's recorded git history, therefore we need to do a little more. You may want to look at [this](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)

 7. Like many command line tools, `git` provides a configuration file (or dotfile) called `~/.gitconfig`. Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline`. You can do this by directly modifying the `~/.gitconfig` file or by using the `git` command line functionality.
    ```bash
    # [alias]                                                                                                                                              graph = log --all --graph --decorate --oneline    
    ```
    This is also a good opportunity to turn your dotfiles folder into a version controlled repo (Use `git init` in your dotfiles folder), make it private if you have sensitive `ssh` configurations there (IP Addresses), else feel free to make it public. (This is for your own benefit, not part of the assignment grading)

 8. You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and set up your global `gitignore` file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific temporary files, like `.DS_Store`, or `.vscode`. Feel free to Google around for common gitignore entries for Python projects or other projects of your interest.

    ```bash
    #My .gitignore configurations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       # Compiled source #                                                                                                                                       ###################                                                                                                                                       *.com                                                                                                                                                     *.class                                                                                                                                                   *.dll                                                                                                                                                     *.exe                                                                                                                                                     *.o                                                                                                                                                       *.so                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                # Packages #                                                                                                                                              ############                                                                                                                                              # it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source                                                                                             # git has its own built in compression methods                                                                                                            *.7z                                                                                                                                                      *.dmg                                                                                                                                                     *.gz                                                                                                                                                      *.iso                                                                                                                                                     *.jar                                                                                                                                                     *.rar                                                                                                                                                     *.tar                                                                                                                                                     *.zip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               # Logs and databases #                                                                                                                                    ######################                                                                                                                                    *.log                                                                                                                                                     *.sql                                                                                                                                                     *.sqlite
